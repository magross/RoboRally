# RoboRally
A server that can host RoboRally games, enforce the game rules and communicate with UI or AI clients using a protocol build upon TCP/IP. The protocol documentation can be found in doc/Dockumentation.pdf; unfortunately, this part is in German only right now, as this server was used for facilitating AI tournaments in Java classes taught in German.
